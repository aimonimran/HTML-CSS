    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Lingo School of Languages was found in 2007 by Muhammad Ghufran Yamin initiated from a single Branch with the goal to expand foreign languages in Pakistan. English Language was the first chosen language to get started with. 
            Since inception till to date many foreign languages are being offered including, English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean. Lingo School of Languages has been expanded from one branch to seven branches during the decade. 
            In our future goal, we are now ready to promote local regional languages in our all campuses. For this purpose, all spade work has been accomplished. Thus the Lingo School of Language is a source where you may polish your abilities and build your capacity to meet the professional challenges of the future. </p>
